## Real-time Traffic sign detection for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) aid in driving and can include assistive and 
safety systems, as well as self-driving agents. However, these systems can be expensive and 
require significant computational power. Traffic sign detection is crucial to ADAS, but it's 
challenging due to limited localized data and object detection difficulty.

This research contributes to traffic sign detection and driver assistance by presenting a 
dataset of 4,000 images with 35 traffic sign types in Sri Lanka using Google Street View 
images. It addresses challenges such as object detection in varying weather and light 
conditions and class imbalance problems through data augmentation and transfer learning. 
Additionally, it presents a smartphone-based driver assistance implementation for real-time 
traffic sign detection.

Results show that models trained on the collected dataset can detect Sri Lankan traffic signs 
and converge faster and more accurately using transfer learning strategies. 
The proposed Android application demonstrates the possibility of creating a real-time 
traffic sign detection application using smartphones' computational power.
