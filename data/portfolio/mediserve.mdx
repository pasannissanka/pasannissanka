### Service Oriented Computing - Group Assignment

Pharmacy management system was created for CSC 313 - Service Oriented Computing Group project, 

Team members were, [Premesh Heshan](https://github.com/Primeshheshan), and [Dasun Malshan](https://github.com/DasunMalshan)

This is a cloud-based Pharmacy management system, where pharmacies can register on the platform and customers can create orders by uploading prescription images. 
Individual pharmacies then can process those prescriptions and then create and dispatch orders through the Admin app.
