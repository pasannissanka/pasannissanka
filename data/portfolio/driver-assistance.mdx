## Smartphone based Driver Assistance system for Human Computer Intraction Project

This system is an android app that is mounted to the windscreen of the vehicle and is able to detect road signs in real-time and act on them. 
Created for CSC 317 - Human-Computer Interaction Group project with [Nihara Mayurawasala](https://github.com/nihara96) 

YOLO V4-tiny algorithm was used for object detection on a custom-created dataset. 
The real-time inference was achieved using Tencent/NCNN library on Java Native Interface (JNI) on Android.
